These steps are as follows. The first iteration consists of steps 1, 2, and 3 – the Product Vision (Research phase), the Design Proposal (Design phase), and the Lo-fi Prototype (Build phase). The second iteration has steps 4, 5, and 6 – Usability Testing of the Lo-fi Prototype (Research phase), the Design Guidelines (Design phase), and the Med-fi Prototype version-1 (Build phase). The third iteration has steps 7, 8, and 9 – Heuristic Evaluation of the Med-fi Prototype version-1 (Research phase), the UI Specifications (Design phase), and the Med-fi Prototype version-2 (Build phase). The fourth iteration has steps 10 and 11 – Usability Testing of the Med-fi Prototype version-2 (Research phase), and the updated UI Specifications (Design phase).
